This project is a Full Stack application that provides a login page built with React on the front end and a powerful asynchronous API using FastAPI on the backend. It utilizes a PostgreSQL database to securely store user data and implements authentication with JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to ensure security.

## ‚ú® Features

- [x] **React**: We use React to create a responsive and user-friendly user interface.
- [x] **FastAPI**: To build an asynchronous API, FastAPI is a high-performance Python framework that offers automatic documentation and is highly scalable.
- [x] **PostgreSQL**: We use PostgreSQL as the database to store user information securely.
- [x] **TailwindCSS**: TailwindCSS allows us to create an elegant and customizable appearance for the application.
- [x] **JWT-Based Authentication**: We implement authentication based on JSON Web Tokens to ensure that only authorized users access protected resources.
